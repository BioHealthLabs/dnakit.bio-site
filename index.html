      <h2>DNA Kit Basics – What You Are Really Buying</h2>
      <p>
        When you buy a DNA kit, you are paying for three things: a physical kit, access to a lab,
        and access to a company&#39;s database and reporting tools. The physical kit is usually the
        simplest part – a tube or swab and a prepaid envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real value lies in how good the company is at processing your sample, how large and
        representative their database is, how transparent they are about methods, and how clearly
        they explain your results.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What a DNA kit typically includes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A saliva or cheek swab collection kit with clear instructions.</li>
            <li>Prepaid return shipping to a partner laboratory.</li>
            <li>Account access to view ancestry and/or health reports.</li>
            <li>Optional features like relative-matching and family tree tools.</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What a DNA kit does <em>not</em> guarantee</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Perfectly precise ethnicity percentages for every region.</li>
            <li>Definitive medical diagnoses or predictions.</li>
            <li>Instant answers about every unknown branch of your family.</li>

      <h2>Comparing Major DNA Test Kits</h2>
      <p>
        Different DNA companies optimise for different things: ancestry depth, relative matching,
        health reports, or user-friendly tools. There is no single “best” kit for everyone, which is
        why independent comparison matters.

      <h2>How to Choose the Right DNA Kit For Your Goal</h2>
      <p>
        Before you click “Buy now”, it helps to be very clear about what you actually want from your
        DNA results. That will narrow your options more effectively than just comparing headline
        prices or marketing slogans.
      </p>

      <ol class="numbered">
        <li>
          <strong>Define your main goal.</strong>
          Is it ancestry, relatives, health markers, or a mix? Different kits prioritise different
          outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check region coverage.</strong>
          Some databases are stronger for Europe and North America, others for specific regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Read the privacy policy.</strong>
          Pay attention to data sharing, research partnerships and deletion options.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Verify shipping &amp; legal availability.</strong>
          Not all tests are available in all countries or with the same features.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compare total cost, not just sticker price.</strong>
          Consider subscriptions, add-on features and sample re-processing fees.

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="card faq">
      <h2 class="section-title">DNA Kit FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Can a DNA kit diagnose medical conditions?</h3>
      <p>
        Consumer DNA kits are not a replacement for medical testing. Some kits include health-related
        risk markers or carrier status, but these are screening tools with limitations. Any medical
        decisions should be made with a qualified professional, not a consumer report alone.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does it take to get results?</h3>
      <p>
        Most companies quote 3–8 weeks from the time your sample arrives at the lab. Delays can happen
        during peak seasons or if a sample fails quality checks and needs to be repeated.
      </p>

      <h3>Can my relatives be identified through my DNA kit?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Even if your relatives have never taken a DNA test, they may be inferred through shared
        DNA with other relatives in the database. This is how many unknown parent or sibling cases are
        solved – and it has both positive and potentially disruptive consequences.
      </p>

      <h3>Is a bigger database always better?</h3>
      <p>
        Larger databases can mean more relative matches and sometimes more precise ancestry estimates,
        especially for well-sampled regions. However, privacy, terms of service and data practices are
        just as important as raw size when choosing a provider.
