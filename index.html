    <section id="dna-kits-101" class="card">
      <h2>DNA Kit Basics – What You Are Really Buying</h2>
      <p>
        When you buy a DNA kit, you are paying for three things: a physical kit, access to a lab,
        and access to a company&#39;s database and reporting tools. The physical kit is usually the
        simplest part – a tube or swab and a prepaid envelope.
      </p>
      <p>
        The real value lies in how good the company is at processing your sample, how large and
        representative their database is, how transparent they are about methods, and how clearly
        they explain your results.
      </p>

      <h3>What is a DNA kit?</h3>
      <p>
        A DNA kit is a simple at-home saliva or cheek-swab test that lets a laboratory analyse
        hundreds of thousands of genetic markers. The lab uses these markers to estimate your
        ancestry, identify genetic relatives and, with some providers, generate selected health
        and wellbeing insights. DNAKit.bio focuses on helping you pick the right DNA test kit
        for your goals before you send your sample.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>What a DNA kit typically includes</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>A saliva or cheek swab collection kit with clear instructions.</li>
            <li>Prepaid return shipping to a partner laboratory.</li>
            <li>Account access to view ancestry and/or health reports.</li>
            <li>Optional features like relative-matching and family tree tools.</li>

            <li>Definitive medical diagnoses or predictions.</li>
            <li>Instant answers about every unknown branch of your family.</li>

    <!-- LIVINGDNA FOCUS SECTION -->
    <section id="livingdna" class="card">
      <h2>Where LivingDNA Fits Among DNA Kits</h2>
      <p>
        Most big DNA brands optimise for either huge relative-matching databases or broad,
        global DNA test kit coverage. <strong>LivingDNA</strong> positions itself more as a
        <strong>specialist</strong> – especially strong for people with British, Irish or
        European roots who care about fine-grained regional breakdowns alongside wellbeing insights.
      </p>

      <div class="grid grid-2">
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>When LivingDNA can be a good first choice</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>You have UK / Irish / European heritage and want detailed regional maps.</li>
            <li>You care more about where within a country your ancestry comes from than about
                building a giant online family tree.</li>
            <li>You want a provider that leans into wellbeing and lifestyle angles as well.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="card-ghost">
          <h3>When a large marketplace kit may be enough</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Your main goal is to find as many genetic relatives as possible.</li>
            <li>You want deep record integration for genealogy (e.g. historical documents).</li>
            <li>You’re okay with broader regional ancestry instead of ultra-detailed maps.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <p>
        One common strategy is to start with a widely used ancestry kit for relative-matching,
        then add LivingDNA later if you want more detailed regional ancestry – especially
        within the UK and Europe.

        <li>
          <strong>Define your main goal.</strong>

          outcomes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Check region coverage.</strong>
          Some databases are stronger for Europe and North America, others for specific regions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Read the privacy policy.</strong>
          Pay attention to data sharing, research partnerships and deletion options.

        <li>
          <strong>Verify shipping &amp; legal availability.</strong>
          Not all tests are available in all countries or with the same features.

        <li>
          <strong>Compare total cost, not just sticker price.</strong>

    <!-- ACCURACY -->
    <section id="accuracy" class="card">
      <h2>DNA Kit Accuracy – What to Expect</h2>
      <p>
        Accuracy is not a single number. It depends on <strong>reference panels</strong>, database size,
        statistical models and how well your specific ancestry is represented in the data. For well-sampled
        populations, ancestry estimates and relative-matching can be very strong; for underrepresented
        regions, results may be broader and updated over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Health reporting is even more nuanced. Some risk markers have strong evidence behind them, while
        others are still being studied. Consumer reports should be treated as <em>screening</em> and
        conversation starters with health professionals, not as final answers.

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="card faq">
      <h2 class="section-title">DNA Kit FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Can a DNA kit diagnose medical conditions?</h3>
      <p>
        Consumer DNA kits are not a replacement for medical testing. Some kits include health-related
        risk markers or carrier status, but these are screening tools with limitations. Any medical
        decisions should be made with a qualified professional, not a consumer report alone.
      </p>

      <h3>How long does it take to get results?</h3>
      <p>
        Most companies quote 3–8 weeks from the time your sample arrives at the lab. Delays can happen
        during peak seasons or if a sample fails quality checks and needs to be repeated.
      </p>

      <h3>Can my relatives be identified through my DNA kit?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Even if your relatives have never taken a DNA test, they may be inferred through shared
        DNA with other relatives in the database. This is how many unknown parent or sibling cases are
        solved – and it has both positive and potentially disruptive consequences.
      </p>

      <h3>Is a bigger database always better?</h3>
      <p>
        Larger databases can mean more relative matches and sometimes more precise ancestry estimates,
        especially for well-sampled regions. However, privacy, terms of service and data practices are
        just as important as raw size when choosing a provider.
